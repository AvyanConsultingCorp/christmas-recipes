* 1kg mixed fruit
* 150ml brandy
* 100g stem ginger in syrup, chopped, plus 2 tbsp of the syrup
* 2 apples or quinces, grated
* 2 oranges, juice and zest
* 6 eggs, beaten
* 250g shredded suet
* 350g soft muscovado sugar
* 250g fresh breadcrumbs
* 175g self-raising flour
* 1 tsp mixed spice


1. Soak the sultanas, raisins, currants, figs, peel, apricots and cherries in the brandy overnight, giving it a good stir now and again.
2. The following day, in a large bowl mix the ginger, syrup, apples or quinces, orange juice and zest with the eggs, suet, sugar, crumbs and flour.
3. Stir in the soaked fruit and spice.
4. Butter the two pudding basins and divide the mix between them.
5. Cut two circles of greaseproof paper to cover the top of the pudding and fold a pleat down the centre to allow pudding to expand.
6. Put lids on the basins and steam puddings for 3½ hours.
7. Let puddings cool before removing greaseproof paper and covering tightly with cling film and lid. The puddings can now be stored in a cool, dry place until Christmas.
8. To reheat, steam pudding for a further 3½ hours, turn out and flame with brandy.
