## Ingredients

* 1 lb plain flour
* 4 oz lard or hard white vegetable fat
* 4oz butter or margarine
* 4-6 tablespoons cold water (you can add zest and juice of an orange instead of some of the water)

## Method

1. Cut the fats into small pieces and rub into the flour using the tips of the fingers until the mixture is like fine breadcrumbs, or use a food processor.
2. Add the water or orange juice, sprinkling over the surface; mix the dough lightly with a round-bladed knife until it forms large lumps.  
3. Gather the dough together with the fingers until it leaves the sides of the bowl clean. Form it into one piece and knead it lightly on a floured surface until firm and free from cracks. Chill for 30 minutes before use. 
4. Roll out the pastry as required, rotating it regularly to keep it an even shape.
