## Ingredients

## Method

1. Roll out the pastry to about 1/8 inch thick.  
2. Use a 3 inch fluted pastry cutter to stamp out the bases and a 2½ inch fluted cutter to stamp out an equal number of lids.
3. Line 2½ inch wide greased patty pans with the large base rounds and fill to about half their depth with mincemeat.
4. Moisten the underside edges of the smaller rounds and place on top, damp side down, over the mincemeat.
5. Press the edges of the pastry lightly together, make a small slit in the top of each pie and brush with milk or egg white.
6. Bake at 425°F, Gas mark 7 for 20 minutes or until light golden brown.
7. Remove the pies from the tins with a round-bladed knife.
