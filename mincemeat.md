(approx yield 4½ – 5 lb)

## Ingredients

* 8oz cooking applies
* 8oz currants
* 8oz raisins
* 8oz sultanas
* 4oz glace cherries
* 4oz chopped mixed peel
* 4oz chopped walnuts, pecans or almonds
* 8oz shredded vegetable suet (or grated white vegetable fat)
* 1 1b Demerara sugar
* 2 level teaspoons mixed spice
* 3-4 fl oz brandy, rum or orange liqueur

You can use any combination of dried fruits – cranberries, apricots, dates, figs etc all work well – just make the total weight of dried fruit the same.

## Method

1. Peel, core and chop the apples
2. Chop or mince any large pieces of fruit
3. Mix in a large bowl with the nuts and apples. 
4. Blend in the suet, sugar and spice.
5. Add enough brandy, rum or liqueur to give a moist mixture.
6. Cover the bowl with a cloth and leave for 48 hours to allow the fruit to swell.
7. Stir well and put the mincemeat into clean jars.  Seal and cover as for jam.  This will keep for several weeks.
